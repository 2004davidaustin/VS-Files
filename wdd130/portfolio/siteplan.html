      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>

        <p>I’m going to make a portfolio website. The most important part of planning this website will be understanding who my audience is. I intend to make this page for my future employers, but also for colleagues, family, friends, and for myself</p>
        <p>I’ll make it for employers so that they can have a quick and up to date way of seeing what I’ve accomplished, and what I can do. I’m also making it for my family and friends so that they can also have a quick and easy way of seeing what I do. I also intend for it to be a personal catalog of my projects where I can quickly review past projects.</p>
        <p>I intend to use this website to answer the questions of who am I? What do I do? What are my passions? Why do I do it? And how can you get in contact with me? The home page can contain an overview of who I am and what I do, my contact information, and contain a basic resume. </p>
        <p>On the home page, I plan on having short showcases of each of the site’s pages. Each of these will contain links to the other pages, descriptions, and photos. Overall, it will be a one stop shop for everything I’m passionate about, good at doing, and the things I’ve done in my life that I’m proud of.</p>

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="images/home_2.jpg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Coding Page</h3>

        <p>This page will be dedicated to showing my expertise in programming. I plan on starting the page with a paragraph at the beginning explaining my specialties, skills, my expertise in the subject, and a short history from when I started programming to today to give the readers a clear understanding of what I can do.</p>
        <p>From there I can show different parts that contain professional projects I’ve worked on in the past and other serious accomplishments. Another part could have links to apps I’ve created or other websites I’ve made, accompanied by descriptions of what they are, what they do, and how I made them. </p>
        <p>And to help showcase what I can do, I could consider adding sections that allow the viewer to try out code that I’ve written and see for themselves how it works. To do that I’d have to learn more about the programming side of website development to integrate it. </p>
        <p>I hope to be able to continue adding to this section in the future as I continue to code and create. In short, it’ll be a very good place to review the most important things I’ve done in coding to impress future employers, but also a good place to review what I’ve done in the past and not forget about old projects.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Photography Page</h3>

        <p>This page will contain photos and art that I’ve created in the past. I big part of this section would be to show my capabilities in design. I’d love to include lots of details that show my passion for photography and why it’s important to me.</p>
        <p>I can have sections showcasing different aspects of photography, including different styles of photography and different techniques. Each section could include a description of how each photo was taken and other background information that’s relevant.</p>
        <p>I could also have a section showing my film photos, and how I make them. I could include a section showing what cameras I use, how I use them, and other gear I use. I can have a section showcasing what I’ve done in photoshop, how I do certain things, and what I’m capable of doing.</p>
        <p>Mostly I want it to really show that I enjoy photography and design, and that it’s something that I’m good at.</p>
