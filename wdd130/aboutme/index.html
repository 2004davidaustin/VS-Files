    <h2>David Austin</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is David Austin. I live in Kaysville Utah where I live with my parents and two younger brothers. I recently got back from serving a full-time mission in Argentina, and I'm excited to start college! I'm majoring in Cybersecurity.

        I like to practice the guitar, practice the piano, play video games, and go to they gym.
        
        I've been a member of the church my whole life, and it holds a special place in my heart. I love the gospel and I'm happy to go to a school where there are many who feel the same.
